This project has been made using rails 6.0.0 as part of my training through the Flatiron Software Enginnering Program.

Grocerylister is a rails webapp that allows a user to make recipes and add those recipes to grocery lists along with other indivudal items.

Lists are categorized by grocery category (e.g. frozen, dairy, meats & cheeses, etc.).

To see how the app works, clone down the repo, run $ rails db:seed and start a sesrver using $ rails s.

Access the app using http://localhost:3000/ and enjoy.
